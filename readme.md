## Features

- **Terminal-Based Interface**: Beautiful and intuitive TUI (Terminal User Interface) powered by [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).
- **Task Management**:
  - Add, delete, and mark tasks as done.
  - Undo deleted tasks (up to 10 actions).
  - Tag tasks for better organization (e.g., `#work`, `#personal`).
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in an SQLite3 database for persistence across sessions.
- **Customizable**: Configure paths for assets and database using a `.env` file.
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed for Linux (other platforms may require minor adjustments).
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and fast performance.
